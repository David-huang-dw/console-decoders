# Dragino LAQ-4 LoRaWAN Air Quality Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LAQ4 is a LoRaWAN Air Quality Sensor for Internet of Things solution. It is designed
to measure the surrounding environment parameters include: TVOC(Total Volatile Organic Compound),
eCO2(equivalent CO2), Temperature and Relative Air Humidity, and then upload to IoT server
via LoRaWAN wireless protocol.

IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) is very important factor for indoor activity and human life.
VOC(Volatile Organic Compound) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids and they
are the main source for poor indoor air quality. LAQ4 provides the trend for IAQ measurement and,
like all other TVOC sensors, LAQ4 requires calibration for more accuracy measurement on TVOC
and eCO2.
